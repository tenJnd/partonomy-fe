      "q1": "What types of drawings does Partonomy support?",
      "a1": "Partonomy is designed specifically for 2D technical drawings in raster format, typically arriving as attachments in RFQ emails. We support PDF, TIFF, PNG and JPEG formats – including scans and older documentation.",
      "q2": "Does Partonomy support CAD drawings or 3D models?",
      "a2": "No. Partonomy doesn't work with CAD or 3D models (STEP, DWG, IGES etc.). We focus exclusively on 2D drawings, as these make up the majority of RFQ requests and are most demanding for manual processing.",
      "q3": "Does the drawing need to be perfectly readable?",
      "a3": "No. Partonomy handles regular scans, poor quality or drawings forwarded from email. Better input quality means better results, but the system is designed for real RFQ operations.",
      "q4": "How accurate is AI analysis?",
      "a4": "The goal is not to replace the technologist or quotation specialist, but to significantly speed up initial drawing processing and decision-making. AI evaluates drawings based on typical manufacturing patterns and helps quickly decide if it makes sense to quote the job.",
      "q5": "Who is Partonomy not suitable for?",
      "a5": "Partonomy is not designed for detailed production preparation, CAD analysis or final price calculation. Greatest value is in RFQ triage – the phase of quick decision-making on incoming requests.",
      "q6": "How quickly can I start and can I try it?",
      "a6": "You start in a few minutes. Just register, login and upload first drawing. You get 14-day trial access for free — no installation and no credit card required."
